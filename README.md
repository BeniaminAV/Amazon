ReactJs, NEXT.JS, Webhooks, Stripe Checkout, Firestore, NextAuth

My application built with NextJs is an online store that enables users to log in through their Google account using NextAuth. Users can make payments with Stripe and view their order history saved on Firebase. The design is created with TailwindCSS, providing a smooth and intuitive shopping experience.
